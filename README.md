**Not Pure Poole** is a simple, beautiful, and powerful Jekyll theme for blogs. It is built on [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole) and [Pure](https://purecss.io/).

> Poole explains that Jekyll has been asking for a particular chemical for days now but every time it has been fetched for him he rejects it as **not pure**. Poole also explains that he caught a glimpse of the man inside and he looked barely human.
